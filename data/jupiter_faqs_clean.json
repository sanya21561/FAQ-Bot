      },

        "answer": "Your phone is repaired at a brand-authorized service center using genuine parts."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I raise a claim?",
        "answer": "Just call +91 8510021818 or email assure@zopper.com. We'll guide you through the next steps."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I have to pay anything extra?",
        "answer": "Only if your repair bill exceeds ₹3,000. If that happens, you'll be informed before repair begins."

        "question": "What's not included?",
        "answer": "Screens already damaged before buying the plan, cosmetic wear (like buttons or casing), any non-screen issues, intentional or careless damage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel or transfer the plan?",
        "answer": "This plan is non-refundable and non-transferable. It's tied to your device."

      },
      {
        "question": "Is water damage covered?",
        "answer": "No. This plan is designed only to cover physical screen damage. If water affects internal parts (like motherboard or battery), it won't be covered—even if the screen gets damaged in the process."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my phone was dropped and got totally smashed?",
        "answer": "If the screen is damaged, you're covered up to ₹3,000. But if internal parts (like battery, camera, sensors) are also broken, you'll need to pay for those separately. Repairs only happen if you approve the full service. No partial fixes."
      },
      {
        "question": "My screen stopped responding to touch. Is that covered?",
        "answer": "Yes, if it happened due to physical damage to the screen. Touch issues caused by screen cracks or falls are eligible under this plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I buy this plan if my screen already has a crack?",
        "answer": "No. If your screen is already damaged, even slightly, the plan won't apply. Only new or undamaged screens can be covered."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I had my phone repaired at a local shop earlier?",
        "answer": "If your phone was tampered with by a non-authorized service center before raising a claim, the plan becomes invalid. No exceptions—even if the tampering was unrelated to screen damage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are backlight issues covered?",
        "answer": "Yes, but only if they're a direct result of screen damage. If the screen broke and the backlight failed too, it's covered. If it's an internal fault not caused by screen damage, it's not."
      },
      {
        "question": "My phone's touch isn't working, but the display is fine. Am I covered?",
        "answer": "Yes. That's likely a digitizer issue, which is part of the screen assembly. If it's due to screen damage, the plan has your back."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about dead pixels on my screen?",
        "answer": "Not covered. Dead pixels are usually due to wear and tear or manufacturing defects, and this plan only covers accidental screen damage."
