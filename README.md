## üß† Architecture & Methodology

- **Scraping:**
  - Extracts Q&A pairs from Jupiter's FAQ/help pages using BeautifulSoup and requests.
  - Data is structured as question‚Äìanswer pairs and saved as JSON for further processing.

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Cleans, normalizes (lowercases, strips whitespace), and deduplicates questions.
  - Ensures each question is unique and answers are concise.

- **Semantic Search (FAISS):**
  - Uses the `sentence-transformers` model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to embed all FAQ questions.
  - Embeddings are indexed with FAISS for fast similarity search.
  - At query time, the user's question is embedded and the most semantically similar FAQ is retrieved.

- **RAG Pipeline:**
  - The user query and the best-matching FAQ (from FAISS) are combined into a prompt.
  - This prompt is sent to the LLM (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 via HuggingFace Inference API) to generate a conversational, context-aware answer.
  - Only the final answer is shown to the user; the prompt and FAQ context are available in an expandable "thinking process" section.

- **Multilingual Support:**
  - The app detects the input language using `langdetect`.
  - If the query is not in English, it is translated to English using the `translate` package before running through the RAG pipeline.
  - The answer is shown in English by default.
  - If the original query was not in English, a button appears to translate the answer back to the user's language (e.g., Hindi, French).
  - This makes the bot accessible to users in multiple languages and demonstrates true multilingual capability.

- **Frontend (Streamlit):**
  - Clean, modern UI for user interaction.
  - Shows only the final answer by default, with an expandable section for transparency (retrieved FAQ, system prompt, etc.).
  - Related questions are shown as clickable buttons for easy exploration.
  - Multilingual support is seamlessly integrated into the user experience.

- **Model Details:**
  - **Semantic Search Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
  - **LLM:** `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` (via HuggingFace Inference API)

- **Bonus: Related Query Suggestions:**
  - After answering, the app uses the same FAISS index to find the top 3 most semantically similar FAQ questions (excluding the one already shown).
  - These are displayed as clickable suggestions below the answer. Clicking a suggestion re-runs the bot with that question.

- **Bonus: RAG vs. LLM Comparison:**
  - A Jupyter notebook `RAG_vs_LLM_comparison.ipynb` runs both the RAG pipeline and a pure LLM approach for a set of test questions.
  - Latency and answer quality are compared, with results included in notebook cells, `rag_vs_llm_results.csv` as well as README.
